# Node.js Project Initializer

An [npm initializer][npm/init] to scaffold a node project and include basic tools like lint, testing, etc.

> _`npm init <initializer>` can be used to set up a new or existing npm package._  
> _`initializer` in this case is an npm package named `create-<initializer>`, which will be installed by `npx`, and then have its main bin executed -- presumably creating or updating `package.json` and running any other initialization-related operations._
